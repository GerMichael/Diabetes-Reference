# Diabetes-Reference
A web application intended to support diabetics handling their everyday life. It allows them to find information about the food they eat in order to manage it properly in the face of the disease. 

This web-project was created by me in the third semester of my study. Since then, nothing has changed considering the feature set and code quality. Unfortunately, the original data-set is not available for the public so dummy data will be used instead. This may change in the future.

Currently, the application gets updated. New technologies and features will be implemented. The current concepting progress can be viewed on <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ljjXDGI=/?invite_link_id=727903907767" target="_blank">the corresponding Miro board</a>.
