# Diabetes-Reference
A web application intended to support diabetics handling their everyday life. It allows them to find information about the food they eat in order to manage it properly in the face of the disease. Unfortunately, the required data is not available for the public so dummy data will be used instead. This may change in the future. 

Currently, the application gets updated. New technologies and features will be included. The current planning progress can be visited on [the corresponding Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ljjXDGI=/?invite_link_id=727903907767)
